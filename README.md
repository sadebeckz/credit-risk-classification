Credit Risk Classification
Overview
This project builds a simple logistic regression model to predict whether a loan is likely to be healthy or high-risk. The goal was to use historical lending data to help a peer-to-peer lending company make better decisions about which loans to approve.

Results
Accuracy: around 95%

Precision (Healthy Loans - 0): very high

Precision (High-Risk Loans - 1): slightly lower, but still good

Recall (Healthy Loans - 0): excellent

Recall (High-Risk Loans - 1): a bit lower than healthy loans

Summary
The model does a great job identifying healthy loans and does a decent job detecting high-risk ones. It's a good starting point, but it could be improved further to better catch risky loans. Based on the results, I would recommend using this model for initial screening, but adding some refinements before relying on it fully for important financial decisions.
